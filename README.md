**MUDATOR (by MUsic recomenDATOR)** it's a program that literally _recomends music by genre_. So if you like rock (for example.) _you can listen some good rock songs that probably you don't know_. Or if you heard a song that you liked at a party and you don't know the name, you might find it if you know the genre... There is so many uses for **MUDATOR!**
You can use the code and apply reverse engineering to add the script to your program, only if you give the credits to _<Krypt0N>_ (the creator) and promise not to use it for profit. _Mainly do not use this script for profit_, I believe in free software.
