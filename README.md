**MUDATOR (by MUsic recomenDATOR)** it's a programm that literally recomends music by genre. So if you like rock (for example.) you can listen some good rock songs that probably you don't know. Or if you heard a song that you liked at a party and you don't know the name, you might find it if you know the genre... There is so many uses for MUDATOR!
You can use the code and apply reverse engineering to add the script to your program, only if you give the credits to <Krypt0N> (the creator) and promise not to use it for profit. Mainly do not use this script for profit, I believe in free software.
